Looping to get links in website: (DONE!!!!)

    Method 1: 
        1. Get all "categories" of recipes
        2. Get all recipe links from the possible categories (it uses relative links, so just concat string)
        3. Remove duplicates
        4. Make condition that if instructions is empty string, remove link

    Method 2: (Priority, cuz it should be faster and simpler)
        1. Get the sitemap of the website from the website's robot.txt thingy
        2. Get all links from the sitemap xml file
        3. Test if links work? (not sure if needed or not)
        4. Filter links to those that contain /recipes and not in categories
        5. Make condition that if instructions is empty string, remove link (not sure if needed or not)


Upload to Firebase:
    1. Loop to all recipes available in website (working on it)
    2. Include code that uploads the json file to firebase immediately after it works (working on it)


Test other websites, whitelist those that have same formatting as Betty Crocker

Must have codes:
    1. Filter links, only keep recipe links (depends on website's link formatting)
    2. Regex stuff, depending on the website's formatting
