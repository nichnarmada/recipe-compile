To-dos:
    1. Main files that have functions of:
        - Get xml file from website.com/robots.txt
            - If there are multiple files, choose using numbers (use dataframe)
            - If none, ask for a manual input instead
        - Get all links from the xml file
        - Loop through all links to get Recipe infos (title, ingredients, etc)
        - Maybe store all links into a json file too, as a stop gap
        - Store into a json file
        - Upload json file to firebase
    2. Have set formulas for conversion (cups to ml, etc) ready in one file
