# recipe-compile

I'm currently developing a web app / mobile app to compile multiple recipes available online into 1 single grocery shopping list. 

Currently, the progress is up until sorting out patterns for 1 single webpage and splitting important data such as quantity and units. Dataset is also converted to a JSON file.
Sample of JSON file is available, file name is called sample.json (JSON file will be uploaded to Firebase)

Next steps would be:

Data Mining
1. Code a loop for all recipe links in a website, and uploading them into Firebase.
2. Whitelist websites that can be generalised with current text pattern
3. Loop all whitelisted websites and upload them to Firebase

Creating Web-app & Mobile-app
4. Use Javascript to make a simple website
5. Connect Firebase database with website
6. Design a proper UI/UX for ease of using website, and to show which websites are whitelisted
